# Dissertation for JSReview
This is the final report for my B.Comp. dissertation (CP4101), where I built a framework for automatic code reviews for JavaScript projects. Please find it in the Report.pdf file.

## Abstract
Peer code reviews are a crucial stage in any software engineering project, where incoming source code is manually analyzed for defects and adherence to best practices to ensure the highest quality of the entire project. However, this manual process is often time and resource-intensive, as well as error-prone and inconsistent. To address these challenges, this project proposes and implements an automated code review framework that reduces human effort while enhancing the quality of the review process – beyond linters. Employing a novel approach that combines machine learning and pattern-based analysis, this hybrid framework is designed to be practically comprehensive, targeting areas of bug detection, code smell identification, vulnerability hotspot assessment, and maintainability risks – which are the focal points of manual code review processes. By integrating the framework with a new GitHub CI/CD platform, this project demonstrates its applicability and potential impact in real-world scenarios. Overall, the quantitative and qualitative evaluations of the framework reveal promising outcomes, paving the way for further refinement and extension of both the core concepts and technical implementation.
